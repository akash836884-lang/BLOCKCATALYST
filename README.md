# BlockCatalyst

## Project Title
BlockCatalyst

## Project Description
BlockCatalyst is a decentralized voting platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to participate in secure and transparent voting processes by casting votes on various proposals. The system is designed to eliminate fraud, ensure immutability, and promote democracy in digital decision-making.

## Project Vision
The vision of BlockCatalyst is to leverage blockchain technology to create a transparent, secure, and trustless voting system that can be applied to governance, elections, and community decision-making processes. We aim to empower communities with the ability to participate in decisions that affect them, all while ensuring the integrity of the voting process.

## Key Features
- **Proposal Creation**: Only the owner of the contract can create new proposals.
- **Voting**: Users can vote on proposals, with each address being able to vote only once.
- **Transparent Results**: The number of votes for each proposal can be publicly viewed by anyone.
- **Security**: Blockchain ensures that all votes are immutable and verifiable.

## Future Scope
- **Multiple Voters**: Introduce role-based access, allowing different levels of users (e.g., admins, regular voters).
- **Delegated Voting**: Allow users to delegate their votes to others, making the system more flexible.
- **Token Integration**: Integrate ERC-20 tokens to incentivize voting or reward users for participating.
- **Multiple Rounds of Voting**: Implement a system where users can vote in multiple rounds or on different issues simultaneously.
- **Off-Chain Voting**: Enable off-chain votes (e.g., via Oracles or Layer 2 solutions) to reduce gas costs while keeping on-chain integrity.
